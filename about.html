  <p>Hello there!  I'm Simeon and I'm just beginning my career as a software developer. This may seem strange for a middle age man, but I wanted a change of career after returning from overseas, where I worked as an EFL teacher for many years.</p>  
  <p>I've had an interest in computers for most of my life, as I've been a keen gamer since the age of eight. My first experience of computer code was typing-in Basic programmes, which were found in computer magazines, into my uncle's BBC Micro. This was the summer of 1983 and it began a longstanding interest in computers; and gaming more specifically.</p>
  <p>In my early twenties I did an A-Level in computer studies, where I learnt a little bit about Pascal. I can't remember much about it aside from the fact that it really put me off programming. At the time I thought that I didn't have an aptitude for coding, I so pretty much gave up on my A-Level; receiving an 'E' grade in the end.</p>
  <p>After studying my A-Levels I went on to university but didn't really touch a computer unless it was to play a game or type up an assignment. I ended up graduating in Creative Writing and Film Studies. After uni, computers were just things for playing games on and I didn't really consider a career in technology as a possibility.</p>
  <p>Now, many years later, I have decided that a career which involves coding is one that would suit me. I learnt a little HTML, CSS and JavaScript from some free online resources and discovered that coding is something I actually get pleasure from. I searched around for some online courses but finally decided to opt for a face-to-face course, as it suits my learning style better.</p>
  <p>So that brings you up to date. I am just about to start a course in web development at Northcoders in Leeds and I hope it will be an enjoyable first step on career path in software development. I'm not sure what the future wil hold, but that is something that makes it very exciting.</p>
